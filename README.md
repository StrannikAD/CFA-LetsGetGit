## CFA Education Hackathon Submission - _Skill Exchange_

### Brief

* How to accommodate both students who are struggling and excelling in a classroom.

### Solution
To solve the above objective, we identified the need to think of the issue from a different perspective. 

This approach is perfectly summarised in our slogan:

>*Everybody has something to offer.* 
>*Everybody has something to gain.*

Students who excel in technical skills may need to boost their soft skills, and vice versa. 

Our solution was to create an online platform, Skill Exchange, where students are able to take a comprehensive skills quiz to identify any knowledge gaps. Subsequently the result of the quiz pairs them with other students according to both of their learning needs.
